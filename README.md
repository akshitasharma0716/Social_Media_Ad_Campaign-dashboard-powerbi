Methodology:
After observation, it was found that there were no null or invalid type values present in the data. However, it was easy to notice that some entries (204 entries) were having error as Column “Clicks” had value 0 but Column “Total_Conversion” had non-zero values. This is illogical because an ad cannot still gain postive conversions (customers) while no one clicks on it. So, after removing those data, Our dataset consist a total of 939 entries.

Feature Engineering

Using the features given in the data set, we can also perform feature engineering to generate some KPIs that are important for later analysis:

CPM (Cost per Mille): It is a metric that represents the cost of displaying an ad to 1,000 people. In other words, it measures how much a business pays for every 1,000 ad impressions.
Cost per click (CPC): It is a metric that represents the cost of getting a user to click on an ad. It measures how much a business pays for every click on their ad.
Click-through rate (CTR): It is a metric that represents the percentage of users who click on an ad after seeing it. It measures the effectiveness of an ad in getting users to click through to a website or landing page.
CPA (Cost per Acquisition/Action): It is a metric that represents the cost of acquiring a new customer through an ad campaign. It measures how much a business pays for every new customer acquired through their ad.
